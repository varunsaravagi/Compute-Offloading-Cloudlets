This is the second reading set obtained as part of the experiments.
It contains readings for the following two cases:

1. Offloading using Socket.io
2. No offloading.

The following scenarios are tested:

1. Increasing computation
2. Increasing data size (this also increases computation to some extent)
3. Increasing both computation and data size.

- The code uses a different serialization mechanism as compared to Reading Set 1.
The following files were used to run the node.js server:
-- cloth_server_diffser.js
-- index.js
- Each file has ~10 readings for each of Latency and FPS. Each reading is an average
obtained over an interval of 6 seconds.
- There are two set of readings for Socket in the files.
-- The first set is the readings obtained while calculating the latency and fps on the 
client side. The readings had jitters in them.
-- The second set is the readings obtained while calculating the latency and fps on the 
server side. The readings did not have any jitters in them.
