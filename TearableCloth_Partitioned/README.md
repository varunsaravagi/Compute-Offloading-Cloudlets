This is a partitioned version of the original Tearable Cloth application.
The application is being partitioned to run in client-server mode.

To test the application, follow these steps:

<li> Download the source code
<li> Install <code>nodejs</code> for your machine
<li> <code>cd</code> in the folder where the source code is downloaded and run <code>npm install</code>.<br>
This would install all the dependencies.
<li> Run <code>node-dev cloth_server.js</code> from the terminal. This will run a server on <code>localhost:1234</code>
<li> Open the url in the browser.
